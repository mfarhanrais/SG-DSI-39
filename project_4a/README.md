## Background
West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States. 

It is most commonly spread to people by the bite of an infected mosquito. Cases of WNV occur during mosquito season, which starts in the summer and continues through fall.

Most people infected with WNV do not feel sick:
* About 1 in 5 people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms
* About 1 out of 150 infected people develop a serious, sometimes fatal, illness.
