    "## 1. Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The trends in intermittent fasting and anorexia have raised concerns due to their potential detrimental effects on physical and mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "Intermittent fasting is a dietary approach that involves cycling between periods of eating and fasting. This has been a trend among Singaporeans who are trying to lose weight (SingHealth, 2021). However, when practiced without proper guidance or medical supervision, it can lead to nutrient deficiencies, muscle loss, and an unhealthy fixation on food and body image. On the other hand, anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by extreme restriction of food intake, can have severe consequences, including malnutrition, organ damage, and even death (SGH, 2019). Click on the following links to find out more:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <a href='https://www.healthxchange.sg/food-nutrition/weight-management/intermittent-fasting-how-to-do-safely'> Intermittent fasting </a>\n",
    "* <a href='https://scc.sg/e/anorexia-nervosa/'> Anorexia nervosa </a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The troubling connection lies in the blurred lines between health-conscious fasting and disordered eating behaviors. Promoting unrealistic body ideals and glorifying extreme fasting methods can inadvertently contribute to the development of anorexic tendencies among vulnerable individuals. It is crucial to prioritize balanced, sustainable nutrition and seek professional guidance when considering any dietary changes to ensure both physical and mental well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "39 SIR, one of the leading healthcare groups in Singapore, seeks to distinguish whether individuals practising intermittent fasting may be exhibiting signs of anorexia nervosa. Our objective is to offer appropriate guidance to ensure that their fasting practices promote overall health or to provide resources on how to seek assistance if they show symptoms of anorexia.\n",

    "In a country where 96.9% of the population are active internet users, 39 SIR is committed to connecting with Singaporeans through digital channels. Our dedicated Data Science team have gone through rigorous research to develop a seamless application that helps individuals and healthcare facilities effectively identify people who may be at risk of anorexia nervosa. This application is designed to facilitate timely interventions and support for those requiring assistance.\n",

    "This application was developed through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Webscraping of subreddits\n",
    "2. Data cleaning\n",
    "3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
